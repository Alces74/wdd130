          <h3>What is white water rafting?</h3>
          <p>
            White water rafting is an outdoor recreational activity where an
            inflatable raft is used to navigate a river or other bodies of
            water. Typically, the water contains varying degrees of rough water,
            or white water, creating a thrilling experience.

        <section class="question">
          <h3>Do I need previous experience to go white water rafting?</h3>
          <p>
            No, many rafting trips are designed for beginners. We offer a range
            of trips suitable for different skill levels, from easy, calm waters
            to challenging, high-adrenaline rapids. Guides provide instruction
            and safety information before and during the trip.

        <section class="question">
          <h3>What should I wear for white water rafting?</h3>
          <p>
            It's best to wear quick-drying, synthetic materials. Avoid cotton as
            it retains water and can make you cold. A swimsuit or shorts and a
            non-cotton t-shirt are good choices. Depending on the weather, you
            may also want a wetsuit, which we do provide for rent. Don't forget
            water shoes or secure sandals.

        <section class="question">
          <h3>Is white water rafting safe?</h3>
          <p>
            While white water rafting has inherent risks, we always prioritize
            safety and provide experienced guides, safety equipment like life
            jackets and helmets, and thorough safety briefings. It's important
            to follow the guide's instructions and wear the provided safety
            gear.

        <section class="question">
          <h3>Can children go white water rafting?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, children can go white water rafting, but the minimum age
            requirement varies depending on the river's difficulty and the
            company's policy. Many family-friendly rafting trips are available
            on calmer sections of rivers, which are suitable for children and
            beginners.

        <section class="question">
          <h3>Can I go white water rafting if I can't swim?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, many non-swimmers go white water rafting. Everyone is required
            to wear a life jacket, which provides buoyancy. It's important to
            inform the guide if you cannot swim so they can take extra
            precautions and provide additional instructions.
